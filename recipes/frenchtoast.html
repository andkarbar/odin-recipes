    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Use whatever stale white bread you have in the bread bin for this fabulous French toast &mdash; it makes a brilliant weekend brunch drenched in honey with fresh berries.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 free-range eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>1 tsp golden caster sugar</li>
    <li>pinch salt</li>
    <li>pinch ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>125ml/4fl oz milk</li>
    <li>½ stale baguette, cut on the diagonal into 2&mdash;3cm/¾in&mdash;1¼in-thick slices, or 2 large, thick slices of stale white bread, cut into triangles</li>
    <li>sunflower oil or butter, for frying</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk together the eggs, caster sugar, salt, cinnamon, vanilla and milk in a shallow dish.</li>
    <li>Dip the pieces of bread into the egg mixture, coating both sides well. Allow the mixture to soak in a little, but not so much that the bread falls apart.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil or butter in a large frying pan.</li>
    <li>Lower the soaked bread into the pan using a fork. Fry for a couple of minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a warm plate, cover and keep warm while you cook the remaining pieces of bread.</li>
    <li>Divide the French toast between two plates, drizzle over the honey and top with the berries.</li>
